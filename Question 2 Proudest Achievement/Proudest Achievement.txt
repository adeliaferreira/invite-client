2. Proudest Achievement

Samsung has a mobile phone theme store, validate this themes 
to be available in store is a manual process that gives more than two weeks.
Our mission was reduce it using machine learning techniques. This project is 
a web + mobile based application that uses a python model to validate this 
themes. I was the only engineer responsible to develop this clients web and
mobile, I'm proud of it because I can design, implement and delivery this in
a way that solve client real world problem and gives very positive feedbacks
from my managers while other projects engineers (Researchers and some assistants)
are focused in create the machine learning models. In the start of this, it'd be an
experimental research but with my work to create this client, in the end of day, it
become a well finished product that really solve client problem and delivered results.
